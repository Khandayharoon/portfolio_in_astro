## Project Overview

The **Full Stack Todo Application** is a task management tool built to provide users with a seamless experience in creating, organizing, and managing tasks. With a focus on both functionality and UI/UX, this application supports user authentication, dynamic task management, and a responsive, intuitive design for efficient task handling.

## Client: Personal Project

## Key Technologies

- **React**: Utilized for creating dynamic user interfaces and managing UI components
- **Node.js** & **Express**: Backend framework for handling API requests and server logic
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing and retrieving user tasks
- **JWT**: Used for secure user authentication and session management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Applied for a responsive and modern UI design
